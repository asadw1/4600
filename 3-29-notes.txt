// Notes on Deadlocks and Resource Graphs 

Resource Graph G(V,E): 

- V: set of vertices (nodes)
 - Resource node
 - Process node
- E: set of edges 
 - Request edge
 - Assignment edge
 - Producer edge 
--------------------------------------
State Transitions:

When P1 requests 1 resource, we draw one edge. One edge per requested 
resource 

------------------------------------------

Request and Acquisitions :

1. Requests -> Any process, P_i that has no outstanding requests 
currently (i.e. not blocked) in a given state may request units of any 
number of resources R_j, R_k,...

2. Acquisition-> A process P_i may ACQUIRE resources that have previously been 
requested units are available for acquistion.
